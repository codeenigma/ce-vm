## vagrant-wrapper.sh

When running any `vagrant` command, you normally need to be in a folder containing a Vagrantfile. 
In the case of ce-vm, it means you can only run vagrant commands from within the ce-vm folder of your project.

This script allows you to run vagrant commands from any directory within your project (provided the root is a git repository).
To use it, add an alias of your choice (vg, vagrant, ce-vm, ...) to your .bashrc/.zshrc file.

```
alias vg="/bin/sh $HOME/.CodeEnigma/ce-vm/ce-vm-upstream/scripts/vagrant-wrapper.sh"
```

*Note: You will need to have used ce-vm at least once before you can add the alias, else the script won't be present yet.*

## vagrant-docker-sudo.sh

On Linux, the docker daemon is only accessible by the root user, meaning you are left with two choices:

1. Running everything as root/sudo. This ends up being a mess of file permissions and ownership and is not really a practical option in a daily "local dev" environment.
2. Adding your user to the "docker" group. This is convenient, and what most people end up doing, but poses a serious [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface) issue.

This script tries to combine the best of both world by wrapping any `vagrant` command, adding your user to the "docker" group before running it, then removing it straight after. It also combine the convenient vagrant-wrapper.sh feature.

### Setup
Before you can use this script, you will need to have used ce-vm at least once. Which involves ... adding yourself to the "docker" group in the first place ! This is temporary, don't worry.

1. Add yourself to the "docker" group: `sudo gpasswd -a "$USER" "docker"`
2. Logout and login from your session (rebooting is the safest)
3. Test you can interact with the docker daemon without sudo: "docker ps -a"
4. Follow the instructions as per the [get started guide](/get-started/usage.md): `cd myproject/ce-vm && vagrant up`

Then, to use it, add an alias of your choice (vg, vagrant, ce-vm, ...) to your .bashrc/.zshrc file.

```
alias vg="/bin/sh $HOME/.CodeEnigma/ce-vm/ce-vm-upstream/scripts/vagrant-docker-sudo.sh"
```

*Note: Not all flavours of Linux have been tested, feel free to suggest ways of ensuring portability.*
