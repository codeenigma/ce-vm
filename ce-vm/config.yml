# Edit these settings to your needs. 
# Keep in mind they will be shared with others working on the project.

############# Project settings.
# Project name. Only use lower alphanumeric chars, no underscore or hyphen.
project_name: example

# PHP version. Can be one of 5.5, 5.6, 7.0.
php_version: 5.6
# Enable xdebug for PHP-FPM
php_xdebug: yes
# Enable blackfire for PHP
php_blackfire: no
# Agent server id and token. You typically would not set it here,
# but use ~/.CodeEnigma/ce-vm/ce-vm-custom/config.yml instead.
# You can find those at https://blackfire.io/account.
php_blackfire_agent_server_id: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX
php_blackfire_agent_server_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
php_blackfire_agent_client_id: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX
php_blackfire_agent_client_token: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Database engine. Can be one of mysql, mariadb or percona-server (recommended)
mysql_engine: percona-server

# NodeJS version. Either 4.x or 6.x.
nodejs_version: ''

# Project type, only 'drupal' is supported for now.
project_type: drupal

# Webroot, relative to project.
# Symfony usually expect this to be "web".
webroot: www

# Mail delivery.
# All outgoing mail is aliased to the local "vagrant" user.
# The delivery can adopt one of 3 behaviors:
# - local: email is kept locally on the guest vm, using the standard mbox.
#   Use vagrant ssh and the "mail" command to read emails.
# - discard: email is sent to /dev/null and not accessible at all.
#   Use this if your app generates a large amount of mail you don't need,
#   to prevent the virtual disk to grow quickly.
# - host: emails are rerouted to the shared var/Maildir folder, as .eml files.
#   You can then read emails on your host using the mail client of your choice.
mail_delivery: host

# If set to yes, runs the default ansible provisioning
# before the one from this project.
# Requires both "git" and the vagrant triggers plugin on your host.
# It will create a clone of the repo:
# git clone -b 2.x git@github.com:codeenigma/ce-vm.git ~/.CodeEnigma/ce-vm-upstream
ce_vm_upstream: no
# Whether to automatically pull changes from the upstream repo.
ce_vm_upstream_auto_pull: yes


# Composer token for github. You typically would not set it here,
# but use ~/.CodeEnigma/ce-vm/ce-vm-custom/config.yml instead.

############# Provider settings.

# Provider. Either virtualbox (safest) or docker (experimental).
vagrant_provider: virtualbox

####### VirtualBox specific settings.

# Shared folder mode.
# NFS offers better performance, but is not supported on Windows hosts.
# In doubt, leave blank to use virtualbox, which offers poor performances,
# but is less likely to fail.
vbox_synced_folder_type: ''
#vbox_synced_folder_type: nfs

# Memory and CPU to use for the app VM.
vbox_app_memory: 2048
vbox_app_cpus: 1

# Memory and CPU to use for the db VM.
vbox_db_memory: 1024
vbox_db_cpus: 1

####### Docker specific settings.

# SSH port for vagrant to use. 
# It must match what is forwarded to port 22 below.
docker_app_ssh_port: 22202
# Ports to forward from the host to the guest,
# in "host:guest" format.
# Be sure the host port is free. Typically port 80
# on your host might be already used by an Apache
# instance on mac OS X.
docker_app_fwd_ports:
 - "22202:22"
 - "8080:80"

docker_db_ssh_port: 22203
