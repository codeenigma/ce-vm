# Project virtual machines for local web development

Spins up a dev environment using Ansible - ala [DrupalVM](https://www.drupalvm.com).
It will fire two VMs, an "app" server with nginx/php and a "db" server for the database.
This is because we find the performance is significantly better with a pair of VMs.
